# Ada-Traffic-Light-Sim
A project for an assessment at Teesside University (BSc Computer Science, 3rd Year Embedded Systems module), that uses Ada to control a software simulation of a set of 4 traffic lights. The idea is to make the logic behind the simulation adhere to various criteria and constraints; to operate as a pair of traffic lights may in the real world.

Only the source code in icasrc is my own; the rest has been created by tutor Phil Brooke.

To operate (Linux), run hwsim as super user from a terminal, and then run the main program. This will cause the program logic to loop. For more information on the hwsim, run hwsim --help at command line. 

Please note that the provided library is built for an older version of Ada, so there may be some coimpatibility issues with newer systems.
